addorderactivity()
	Submit messages for an order to the Zazzle customer support staff.
	This uses URI::Escape to encode the message prior to submission.
	We must now expect URI::Escape as a run-time dependency.
	Documentation for this method is also included in this commit.

----------------------------
revision 1.12
date: 2014/08/10 06:54:24;  author: ted;  state: Exp;  lines: +21 -3
Add ackorder method. This method should never be called directly,
and will not be covered in the documentation. Instead, subsequent
wrappers will be written defining type and action parameters.

Also, cleanup getshippinglabel with a few nits, and use simpler
'eq' for string comparison instead of unnecessary regex.

Bump version number according to this repository.
This version number and the contents of CHANGES
will not always be in sync during development. It
is the goal of the project to synchronize the
version and the CHANGES file at times of release.

Next commit will introduce necessary files for
CPAN compatibility. Licensing is reserved until
the project is ready for distribution.

proper include of Digest::MD5 to remove redundant calls
----------------------------
revision 1.8
date: 2014/08/09 21:38:26;  author: ted;  state: Exp;  lines: +20 -20
MD5 hashes are generated for each call, and use required elements
such as orderid, weight, etc. So, quit generating a default hash
when zazzle object is created. Instead, store the secret key in
this object, and let each method generate its own required hash.

While here, reformat usage documentation allowing more space.

Redo url handling:
	Remove 'method' object.
	Define baseurl which should never be modified.
	Let each method define relevant url.
	Add url error handling and include in dump.
