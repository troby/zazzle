Module for integration with Zazzle.com REST API

These methods allow for interfacing with the REST API provided by
Zazzle.com for their customers. It is designed as the back-end piece
to a web-based Order Management System. The construction of these
methods as well as the suggested error handling followed came from
the document provided by: 'Zazzle Vendor API Documentation v1.12.pdf'.
